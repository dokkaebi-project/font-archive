               Usage: breakcpi [-f] [-i] [-d] filename

Will read 'filename' as a DOS 3.3+ cpi file, analyze it, and store each of the
screen fonts in it to a file. The font files thus generated are named CPxxx.Fyy
where 'xxx'is the 3 digit DOS code page number and 'yy' is the font height.

EXAMPLE             breakcpi ega.cpi

FLAGS   -h   Display this message
        -f   Overwrite existing font files
        -i   Report if extracted font is identical to existing font file
        -d   Report if extracted font is different than existing font file
        -s   Silent mode. No overwrite complain messages

BUGS    Does not recognize all CPI files internals. In particular it fails on        printer (4201 etc.) CPI files.

COPYING POLICY Copy freely for private use. Usage as part of any commerical
  package is under the same restrictions as of Rhaul Dehsi ZOO program. If you
  cannot obtain ZOO, you cannot use 'breakcpi' commercially.
