  Usage: TRIMFONT [flags] [inpfont [outfont]]

TRIMFONT reads `inpfile' as a font file. It then determines the font extent
i.e., the minimal and maximal used row in the font grid. Based on this extent,
the input font is then trimmed to its minimal height and dumped to `outfile'.
If `outfile' is missing, then TRIMFONT will dump the output font to the
standard output. If `inpfile' is missing as well, then TRIMFONT will take
its input from the standard input. However, TRIMFONT will not read or dump
to console, and (by default) will refuse to overwrite existing files.

FLAGS
  -f         Force mode. Allow overwriting existing outfile.
