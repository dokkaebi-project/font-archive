Usage:   LOADFONT [height] [range] [flags]                 (use standard input)
  or     LOADFONT [height] [rangeop(s)] [flags] fontfile        (use font file)

Will load a text-mode font from stdin/fontfile to the EGA/VGA adapter memory.
LOADFONT looks for 'fontname' in the current directory and then in all
the directories specified in the FONTPATH environment variable. Multiple
directories in FONTPATH are separated by ';' chars.

    'height' is the number of scan lines per character. When this parameter
is absent LOADFONT tries to make an educated guess of the height based on the
system's display adapter (1st form), the last two charcaters of the FONFILE
extension, and the size of FONTFILE (2nd form).

    'range' in the form of n:m specifies that font has to be loaded for
characters n..m. The default is 0:255. Range aliases such as 'digit' are
recognized. 'rangeop' in the form of [+|-]RANGE allows a finer control on
which characters a font is to be loaded. Rangeop aliases such as 'alnum' are
recognized.
