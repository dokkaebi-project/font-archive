Here is a partial list of programs by Yossi Gil. Please contact the
author at the addresses given at the bottom of this file if you wish 
to gain access to any of these programs. None of the programs require 
shareware fee from private users. 

I also maintain a large (over 200) collection of EGA/VGA text mode fonts.  
All these fonts can be freely used and distributed.

Some more information on TERSE a 4096 bytes editor, and SLIM,
its bigger brother is given below.

TERSE is a tiny (only 4096 bytes) but amazingly powerful full-screen
editor for files of up to 64K in length.  TERSE runs on all PC compatible
machines.  Its command keys are very similar to those of the famous
BRIEF editor (by UnderWare Inc.).  TERSE can edit both UNIX and MS-DOS
style text files as well as binary files.  No hacker's disk is complete
without it.  No disk, be it hard or floppy, is too full to include it.

TERSE is free (but copyrighted) to private users.  If you are a private
user who uses TERSE "for pleasure", you are not required to register.
However, if you use TERSE for any commercial application, i.e., in
your company, at work, etc., or make money from selling software or
distributing shareware, you are *required* to register your copy of TERSE.
Registration cost is only $15 and buys you a personalized version, and
grant your institution a site license.  For an additional payment of 
only $5, you get the source code of TERSE.

Highlights
==========
 o  Very small: fits in 4096 bytes = 4 clusters on 5.25"/3.5" floppies.
 o  Minimal free memory requirements: 137KB.
 o  Uses current screen size, including the most common 80x25 screen
    dimensions but also unusual sizes such as 40x16, 40x25, 40x40,
    40x50, 132x25, 132x43, 96x33, 80x30, 80x33, etc.
 o  Fully DESQview (version 2.0 and above) aware.
 o  Edit binary files. TERSE is ideal for a quick and dirty job
    of editing and patching strings in small programs. 
 o  Supports editing of UNIX style files (lines terminated with '\n').
 o  Supports both '/' and '\' as directory separator.
 o  Edit lines of unlimited length (limited only by file size).
 o  Automatic unlimited horizontal scrolling.
 o  BRIEF-like keyboard configuration.
 o  Support for TABS, and configurable tab positions.
 o  Prevents snow when run on a CGA screen.
 o  CUT, COPY and PASTE
 o  SEARCH, SEARCH again, and TRANSLATE commands.
 o  Safe: confirm exits when text is not saved.
 o  Edit files whose name contains spaces and other weird names.
 o  Extended version (the SLIM editor) of size ~5k with many more
    features, including support (via external filters) for word count, 
    sorting, charcter codes translations, quoting, tab expansion and
    unexapnsion, and other complex editing tasks.
 o  Status line indicating: current column, current line, horizontal
    scrolling, total number of lines, file name, modified status,
    insert/overwrite status, the current offset in file and total file size 
    in bytes are dispalyed in the status line. The extended version 
    also displays the HeX value of the current char.

Requirements
=============
 o  PC-DOS/MS-DOS version 2.0 or higher
 o  137KB free memory
 o  64KB free disk space

SLIM can do every thing TERSE can, and has the following additional 
features:

   o  "read file into buffer" command <Alt-R>
   o  "switch to another file" command <Alt-E>, 
   o  "go to line number" command <Alt-G>, 
   o  "set right margin" command <Alt-M>,
   o  "swap cursor and mark" command <Shift-Tab>, 
   o  "pump block thru external filter" command <Alt-F>, 
   o  "exchange marked block with paste buffer"  command <Keypad*>, and 
   o   display of the hexadecimal value of the current char in the 
       status line. 

   The current char display uses a special notation for the TAB, EOF
   and CR characters as well as for the CRLF combination.

   My favourite new command is "pump block thru external filter" 
   (<Alt-F> key), which can be undone (and then redone) by the 
   "exchange block with paste buffer"  command (<Keypad*> key).
   Think of the possibilities: formatting, spelling, word counting, 
   sorting, sed and awk, DOS and 4DOS commands etc.
