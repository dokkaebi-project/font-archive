  Usage: WITHFONT fontfile command [arg(s)]
         WITHFONT fontfile [ [-bN fontfileN] ... ]  [ -c ] command [arg(s)]

Will run 'command' on 'args' using a text-mode font loaded from 'fontfile'.
WITHFONT looks for 'fontname' in the current directory and then in all the
directories listed in the FONTPATH environment variable. Multiple directories
in FONTPATH are separated by ';' chars. The 'fontfile' name should be of the
form *.fYY, where YY is the font height in pixels (a 2 digit number in the
range 04-32). If the font height cannot be determined from the file name,
then it is set to the file size divided by 256. All fonts loaded must be of
the same height. The font load will not be effected by 'command' changing
the video mode. WITHFONT cures some of MS-DOS 3.3+ CodePage braindamage.
